# Kickstarter-analysis


## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help the Client *Louise* visualize the outcomes of their Kickstarter project based on launch dates and funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis focused on two specific measurables, namely; Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the first analysis the number of successful, failed and canceled Theater projects based on launch date were tabulated and the results plotted in the table as seen here  https://github.com/Jusharry/Kickstarter-analysis/commit/ba1304b1bc6ffea6a942ccbd8ee43bd97c327f45#commitcomment-59019987. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second analysis involved calculating the number and percentages  of successful, failed and canceled plays based on pre-defined goal categories and was demonstrated as follows: https://github.com/Jusharry/Kickstarter-analysis/commit/ba1304b1bc6ffea6a942ccbd8ee43bd97c327f45#commitcomment-59019771. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no substantial challenges encountered during either of these deliverabes as both were covered in depth during the course work . I could potentially see an issue with the outcomes based on goals deliverable as the formula required did require careful placement of the >, >= and <= modifiers to get the desired result.

## Results

-What are two conclusions that you can draw from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? 
The first conclusion that can be drawn from that data is that the month of May was the most successful and had the most overall starts of theater projects. Secondly there were on average 70% more successful starts than failed starts over the 12-month period.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It can be concluded based on the Outcomes by Goals that plays with a funding goal of less than $5000 have the highest likelyhood of success.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
n/a

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A column chart  as well as a stacked bar could have been used to illustrate the Outcomes based on Goals.
